# Omni Stack Week - Third Day (15/01)

## Goals:

Develop the frontend of application with React.
For start this part of project, do you need create a new directory in the same hierarchy of **backend**. Before, a new directory called **web** will be create with many other directories and filles... 

```
$ yarn create react-app web 
```
For run the project, write:
```
$ cd web/src
$ yarn start
```
> Again, is possible to see the response of local request acessing http://localhost:3000/

> For see the response on your network, do you need acess a url as the example: http://192.168.0.12:3000/, because the path change for each computer 

For API can be acess by React, write in command prompt:
```
$ yarn add cors 
```
For use axios, write:
